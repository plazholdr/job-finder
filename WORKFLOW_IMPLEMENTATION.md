   - Reminder notifications and escalations
   - Weekly analytics generation

3. **NotificationService** (Enhanced)
   - Workflow-specific notifications
   - Real-time updates for status changes
   - Email and in-app notifications

4. **ApplicationModel** (Enhanced)
   - Additional methods for workflow analytics
   - Stage statistics and bottleneck detection
   - Stuck application identification

### Frontend Components

1. **Enhanced Workflow Page** (`frontend/src/app/company/applications/enhanced-workflow/page.tsx`)
   - Complete workflow management interface
   - Decision point handling
   - Required field validation
   - Real-time status updates

2. **Workflow Dashboard** (`frontend/src/app/company/applications/workflow-dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Analytics and performance metrics
   - Bottleneck identification
   - SLA monitoring
   - Stage distribution charts

3. **Workflow Visualization** (`frontend/src/components/workflow/WorkflowVisualization.tsx`)
   - Visual representation of workflow progress
   - Interactive stage indicators
   - Progress tracking

## Workflow Stages

Based on the provided diagram, the system implements these stages:

1. **submitted** - New application received
2. **first_level_review** - Initial HR screening
3. **pending_acceptance** - Awaiting acceptance decision
4. **accepted** - Application accepted for detailed review
5. **shortlisted** - Candidate shortlisted for interview
6. **interview_scheduled** - Interview appointment set
7. **interview_completed** - Interview process finished
8. **offer_extended** - Job offer sent to candidate
9. **offer_accepted** - Candidate accepted offer (final state)
10. **offer_declined** - Candidate declined offer (final state)
11. **rejected** - Application rejected (final state)

## Decision Points

The system includes automated decision points as shown in the diagram:

- **First Review Decision**: Does the application meet basic requirements?
- **Acceptance Decision**: Should we accept this application for detailed review?
- **Shortlist Decision**: Should this candidate be shortlisted for interview?
- **Interview Decision**: Based on interview performance, what is the decision?

## Automated Features

### Workflow Automation
- Automatic transitions based on predefined rules
- Time-based escalations and reminders
- SLA monitoring and violation alerts
- Scheduled health checks

### Notifications
- Real-time status change notifications
- Interview invitations and reminders
- Offer letters and expiration warnings
- Rejection notifications with feedback

### Analytics
- Stage distribution analysis
- Conversion rate tracking
- Bottleneck identification
- Processing time metrics
- Weekly performance reports

## API Endpoints

### Workflow Management
- `POST /workflow/transition` - Transition application to new stage
- `GET /workflow/stages/:stage/actions` - Get available actions for stage
- `GET /workflow/stages/:stage/decision` - Get decision point for stage
- `POST /workflow/automation/process` - Trigger automated processing
- `GET /workflow/health` - Perform health check

### Enhanced Application Endpoints
- All existing application endpoints are enhanced with workflow support
- Status transitions are validated against workflow rules
- Automated actions are triggered on status changes

## Configuration

### Workflow Stages Configuration
Each stage includes:
- Allowed transitions
- Required fields for transition
- Automated actions to execute
- SLA timeframes

### Decision Points Configuration
Each decision point includes:
- Associated workflow stage
- Decision question
- Available options with weights
- Next stage mappings

### Automation Rules
- Time-based transition rules
- Condition checking for automated transitions
- Escalation and reminder schedules
- SLA violation thresholds

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Health Monitoring
- Stuck application detection (no updates in 7+ days)
- Bottleneck identification (high volume + long processing time)
- SLA violation tracking
- System health scoring

### Performance Metrics
- Total applications processed
- Average processing time per stage
- Conversion rates between stages
- Stage distribution analysis
- Weekly trend analysis

### Alerts and Notifications
- Health degradation alerts
- SLA violation notifications
- Bottleneck warnings
- Performance trend alerts
